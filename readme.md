# MiniFilter Project

## Description

This is a tiny project using Python and Tkinter library.

I used an entry widget and a treeview widget on the main window and the idea is when the user type in the entry widget the treeview show the results in real time. The script has a list of data examples (list of customers) to test the functionality.

When te entry widget has value this value is look into the data, in this case in the customer's name and I say "value" because the search is made by character by character doesn't matter if the character is upper case or lover case. If the string of values is found the treeview shows the results doesnÂ´t matter where the string is located.

If the string of values in the entry widget is not found the treeview shows (yes, you're right!) nothing and if the entry widget is empty the treeview shows all the values.

I use autopep8 as a document format for the scripts.
